Source UI Workflow:

page 1 default-> 
amazon/myntra type decor UI with 1 or many ad pics of products
if user chooses to do nothing (remain still) its counts as banner_show
else if user clicks on one of the ad
he is diverted to page 2 
Page 2->
ALL about the product clicked on, n a button to order/puurchase now
if user does nothing on this page then its banner_click
else if he clicks on order now button then should go to page 3
Page 3->
Just shows order successful
